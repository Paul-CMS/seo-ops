### HANDOFF · /new-client · 2026-10-05 · run 20261005-210907-new-client-b5e9
**What I did**
- Created the client record: Apex Roofing of the Lowcountry, apexroofingtlc.com, full client, industry roofing.
- Recorded intake: GBP https://maps.app.goo.gl/AWfz3YNkwvsrggFg7 · service-area business · GBP Website field `http://www.apexroofingtlc.com/` · no Search Console or GA4 access.
- Set the safe-fix cap on Paul's word: 5 alt texts, 2 broken links, until he has checked them live.
- Built the Drive folder `Apex Roofing of the Lowcountry - TMS` in v3 with the template's folders (01 - Discovery and Audit/Evidence and Deliverables, 02 - Build, 03 - Finish, 04 - Blog, _Archive).
- Created the Brand Guide working copy from the template (every field still blank) and started `test-run-notes.md`.

**What was decided, and why**
- Not a sensitive client: the category check returned "no" for roofing (CM-025, CM-040).
- No GSC/GA4: rankings and destructive-candidate checks rely on DataforSEO only (CM-019, CM-021).
- The connector can't copy folders, so the template folder tree was rebuilt by hand (matches the template as of today).

**Unresolved — and who owns it**
| Item | Owner | Blocking what |
|---|---|---|
| WordPress `seo-ops` Editor user + Application Password (handoff issued right after this run) | Jonie | /wp-check, any WordPress step |
| `WP_APEX_ROOFING_OF_THE_LOWCOUNTRY_URL / _USER / _APP_PASSWORD` in .env | Paul | /wp-check |
| Whether the older Apex folders elsewhere in Drive are source material | Paul | Nothing yet (discovery can use them if he says so) |

**What the next step needs, and where it is**
| Artifact | Path | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Brand Guide | clients/apex-roofing-of-the-lowcountry/brand-guide.md | Blank template |
| Drive folder | https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DN9Lji_McIOo9i2eFLV-u7eXrvY00G37 | Created |

**What I could not check**
- The GBP listing and the WordPress connection (not set up yet). Whether the http://www. GBP link and the https:// site resolve to the same place — discovery checks that.

**Anything the next agent would otherwise get wrong**
- No Search Console or GA4. And the GBP Website field (`http://www.`) differs from the site URL as given (`https://`, no www) — record what each resolves to; it is not a finding until the audit.
