# Apex Roofing of the Lowcountry - Handoff Log

Generated from the safety log (clients/apex-roofing-of-the-lowcountry/log.md) — do not edit. Each run adds its section with `run.py finish --handoff <file>`. The newest section is at the bottom.

## /new-client · 2026-10-05 · run 20261005-210907-new-client-b5e9

**What I did**
- Created the client record: Apex Roofing of the Lowcountry, apexroofingtlc.com, full client, industry roofing.
- Recorded intake: GBP https://maps.app.goo.gl/AWfz3YNkwvsrggFg7 · service-area business · GBP Website field `http://www.apexroofingtlc.com/` · no Search Console or GA4 access.
- Set the safe-fix cap on Paul's word: 5 alt texts, 2 broken links, until he has checked them live.
- Built the Drive folder `Apex Roofing of the Lowcountry - TMS` in v3 with the template's folders (01 - Discovery and Audit/Evidence and Deliverables, 02 - Build, 03 - Finish, 04 - Blog, _Archive).
- Created the Brand Guide working copy from the template (every field still blank) and started `test-run-notes.md`.

**What was decided, and why**
- Not a sensitive client: the category check returned "no" for roofing (CM-025, CM-040).
- No GSC/GA4: rankings and destructive-candidate checks rely on DataforSEO only (CM-019, CM-021).
- The connector can't copy folders, so the template folder tree was rebuilt by hand (matches the template as of today).

**Unresolved — and who owns it**
| Item | Owner | Blocking what |
|---|---|---|
| WordPress `seo-ops` Editor user + Application Password (handoff issued right after this run) | Jonie | /wp-check, any WordPress step |
| `WP_APEX_ROOFING_OF_THE_LOWCOUNTRY_URL / _USER / _APP_PASSWORD` in .env | Paul | /wp-check |
| Whether the older Apex folders elsewhere in Drive are source material | Paul | Nothing yet (discovery can use them if he says so) |

**What the next step needs, and where it is**
| Artifact | Path | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Brand Guide | clients/apex-roofing-of-the-lowcountry/brand-guide.md | Blank template |
| Drive folder | https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DN9Lji_McIOo9i2eFLV-u7eXrvY00G37 | Created |

**What I could not check**
- The GBP listing and the WordPress connection (not set up yet). Whether the http://www. GBP link and the https:// site resolve to the same place — discovery checks that.

**Anything the next agent would otherwise get wrong**
- No Search Console or GA4. And the GBP Website field (`http://www.`) differs from the site URL as given (`https://`, no www) — record what each resolves to; it is not a finding until the audit.

## /wp-check · 2026-10-05 · run 20261005-211116-wp-check-0f33

**What I did**
- Checked from the public site that apexroofingtlc.com runs WordPress: Kadence theme, Kadence Blocks + Pro, WPForms User Journey, AccelerateWP; Apache host. `http://www.apexroofingtlc.com/` (the GBP Website field) 301s in one hop to `https://apexroofingtlc.com/`.
- Issued handoff H-2026-10-05-01-other to Jonie: create the `seo-ops` Editor user and its Application Password (sent to Paul privately, never in the worksheet), and record the SEOPress version, permalink setting and any security plugin — record only, nothing changed.

**What was decided, and why**
- The connection test (`wp.py check`) was not run: there are no credentials yet, so it could only fail. It runs once Jonie is done and Paul has added the .env lines.
- Handoff sent to Jonie rather than the `other` default (Gwen): WordPress setup is WordPress work (CLAUDE.md §4).

**Unresolved — and who owns it**
| Item | Owner | Blocking what |
|---|---|---|
| H-2026-10-05-01-other — seo-ops Editor user, Application Password, SEOPress/permalink/security record | Jonie | /wp-check |
| `WP_APEX_ROOFING_OF_THE_LOWCOUNTRY_URL / _USER / _APP_PASSWORD` in .env | Paul | /wp-check |

**What the next step needs, and where it is**
| Artifact | Path | Status |
|---|---|---|
| WordPress setup handoff | clients/apex-roofing-of-the-lowcountry/handoffs/H-2026-10-05-01-other.md (+ .csv) | Issued to Jonie |

**What I could not check**
- The WordPress connection, SEOPress version, and whether the REST API is open — all need the seo-ops login.

**Anything the next agent would otherwise get wrong**
- Discovery does not need WordPress. It can run now; /wp-check is only needed before the first WordPress step (safe fixes after the audit approval).

## /drive-mirror · 2026-10-05 · run 20261005-211145-drive-mirror-3ea9

**What I did**
- First upload to the client Drive folder: Handoff Log, Approval Record and Document Checklist as real `.md` files under their standard names. Nothing to archive (no earlier copies).

**What was decided, and why**
- The Brand Guide is not mirrored yet: it is still the blank template. It goes up once discovery fills Section A.

- Later mirrors are archive-and-replace (dated name → `_Archive`, upload new), never a second copy beside the first.

## /discovery · 2026-10-05 · run 20261005-211303-discovery-aee7

**What I did**
- Discovery from free public sources (S01–S03, all recorded done): live site, GBP public view, Facebook, BBB, HomeAdvisor, OpenCorporates copy of the SC record, WHOIS, Wikipedia/Wikidata. No paid calls.
- Proposed the entity foundation: category "Roofing contractor" (Wikipedia: Roofer, Q552378); area Hilton Head Island–Bluffton–Port Royal MSA (Q17020871) by Russian Doll Bluffton → Beaufort County → MSA, containing all 12 location-page cities; variants Roofing Contractor / Roofer / Roofers / Roof Mechanic; reserved homepage variant "Hilton Head Island Metropolitan Area".
- Wrote the Discovery Record (REVIEW) and the public-sources evidence capture; filled Brand Guide A, B and the Section F Wikidata rows as proposals.

**What was decided, and why**
- Nothing resolved: ten conflicts recorded with all candidate values (C1 Georgia service area, C2 start date, C3 owner roles, C4 residential vs commercial, C5 name form, C6 BBB street address on an SAB, C7 Levy county, C8 Okatie county, C9 ratings, C10 MSA name). None is a methodology conflict, so no PROC-01 entry.

**Unresolved — and who owns it**
| Item | Owner | Blocking what |
|---|---|---|
| Entity foundation | Paul (`entity_approved`) | Proof sheet |
| C1 — does Apex serve Coastal Georgia? (would change the area entity) | Paul / client via proof sheet | Area entity is final only once answered |
| Q8 "Hilton Head Island Metro Area" as a variant · Q9 one county URI or both | Paul | Schema later; entity approval now |
| SC SOS and SC LLR lookups (CAPTCHA) | Gwen or Paul, manual | Licence + legal entity stay "found", not verified |
| GBP secondary categories / service-area list (dashboard only) | Paul / client | BB-107 check |
| Domain apexroofingtlc.com expires 2026-11-23 (WHOIS) | Paul to mention to the client | Nothing in the system — but the site goes dark if it lapses |

**Anything the next agent would otherwise get wrong**
- "Apex Roofing of Coastal Georgia" (St. Simons Island, GAF directory) may be a different company — don't merge its facts. And every service/location H1 already starts "The Best…": that is an observation, not a finding, until the audit (CM-020).

## /drive-mirror · 2026-10-05 · run 20261005-212655-drive-mirror-c34f

**What I did**
- Archive-and-replace for the Handoff Log and Document Checklist: old copies renamed with `- 2026-10-05` and moved into `_Archive`; new versions uploaded under the standard names.
- First upload of the Brand Guide (Sections A, B and F proposals from discovery).

**What was decided, and why**
- The Approval Record was left as it is: its content has not changed since the first upload (every decision still pending).

## /discovery · 2026-10-05 · run 20261005-215259-discovery-acd3

**What I did**
- Applied Paul's direction on the entity proposal to the Brand Guide (A, B, F) and the Discovery Record (new §3.6; C1 annotated). Nothing else changed.

**What was decided, and why**
- Area entity: **South Carolina Lowcountry** (Wikipedia title; Wikidata Q3885311), Paul's choice over the smaller Hilton Head Island–Bluffton–Port Royal MSA. This deviates from BB-105's "smallest true container" and is logged as Paul's decision. It contains all 12 cities, and BB-105's own Beaufort + Jasper example names it.
- Reserved homepage variant: **South Carolina Lowcountry**. Bare "Lowcountry" is in the brand name on every page, so it can't be homepage-only; it goes into the rotation pool.
- Category variants: Roofing Contractor, Roofer, Roofers. Roof Mechanic is excluded; Residential Roofer stays a candidate only.
- Georgia is not served currently (Paul). C1 is closed for the entity; the homepage "& Coastal Georgia" line stays an observation for the audit.

## /discovery · 2026-10-05 · run 20261005-221139-discovery-5ddf

**What I did**
- Applied Paul's second direction on the area entity to the Brand Guide (A5, A6, derivation, B1, B2, F) and the Discovery Record (new §3.7).

**What was decided, and why**
- Area entity: back to the **Hilton Head Island–Bluffton–Port Royal, SC MSA** (Q17020871). The brand name "Apex Roofing of the Lowcountry" is in every SEO title, so a Lowcountry area entity would repeat it. This is also BB-105's smallest container, so the earlier deviation is gone.
- Reserved homepage variant (homepage SEO title): **Hilton Head Island–Bluffton–Port Royal Metropolitan Area**.
- "South Carolina Lowcountry" and "Lowcountry" stay in the rotation pool but are never used in an SEO title — H1, H2s and body only.
- Category (Roofing Contractor; variants Roofing Contractor, Roofer, Roofers) and Georgia (not served) are unchanged.

**Unresolved — and who owns it**
| Item | Owner | Blocking what |
|---|---|---|
| Wording of the reserved variant: "…Metropolitan Area" (default) or "…Metro Area" (Q8) | Paul | entity_approved |
| Whether the Lowcountry-out-of-SEO-titles rule applies site-wide (default) or to the homepage only | Paul | entity_approved |
| `entity_approved` on the revised files | Paul | Proof sheet |

**What I could not check**
- —

**Anything the next agent would otherwise get wrong**
- §3.7 supersedes the area part of §3.6. The area entity is the MSA, not South Carolina Lowcountry.

## /wp-check · 2026-10-05 · run 20261005-221818-wp-check-1c23

**What I did**
- Ran /wp-check with the credentials Paul added. Credentials, REST API, login and draft creation all worked; two test drafts were created and trashed (logged). SEOPress site-wide settings were readable and saved as audit evidence (`inputs/seopress-settings-2026-10-05.json`).

**What was decided, and why**
- Result: **not connected**. SEOPress per-page fields were written to the test draft but couldn't be read back. A `wp.py get` on the live homepage (read-only) also reads every SEOPress field as empty, so `wp.py` doesn't understand how SEOPress 10.0.1 reports them. The check fails rather than guessing (setup §5).

**Unresolved — and who owns it**
| Item | Owner | Blocking what |
|---|---|---|
| `wp.py` SEOPress read for 10.x (map the response, add a test) | System fix round (Paul's go) | Every WordPress write and /verify — not the proof sheet, crawl or audit |
| Login is an Administrator, not the dedicated Editor | Paul (Jonie switches the role, or Paul allows it) | Nothing yet |
| Kadence head-code meta key | Found during the pilot | Schema (Finish) |

**What I could not check**
- Any SEOPress per-page value (reads come back empty on 10.0.1).

**Anything the next agent would otherwise get wrong**
- Empty SEOPress values from `wp.py get` on this site do NOT mean the pages have no SEO title or meta. It is a read problem. Use the crawl for live titles and meta until `wp.py` is fixed.

## /wp-check · 2026-10-05 · run 20261005-223142-wp-check-24f5

**What I did**
- Re-ran /wp-check after the SEOPress 10.x fix (commit e0cdf3b). Every SEOPress per-page field was written to a test draft and read back; both test drafts were trashed. Result: **connected** (valid 30 days).

**What was decided, and why**
- Nothing new. The login is still an Administrator (NOTE, not a failure) — Paul's call whether Jonie switches it to Editor.

**Anything the next agent would otherwise get wrong**
- This site runs SEOPress 10.0.1; `wp.py get` now reads its stored values. Use `wp.py raw-seo` if a field ever looks wrong.

## /discovery · 2026-10-05 · run 20261005-223335-discovery-40fe

**What I did**
- Wrote Paul's last two entity answers into the Brand Guide (B2) and the Discovery Record (§3.7): the reserved variant stays "Hilton Head Island–Bluffton–Port Royal Metropolitan Area", and the brand is always written in full in SEO titles.
- Re-recorded the entity decision's files with the Brand Guide by section (`brand-guide.md#A+B1+B2`), so later Brand Guide work doesn't cancel it.
- Issued H-2026-10-05-02-manual_lookup to Gwen: SC Secretary of State record, SC LLR licence, and the GBP dashboard (categories, service areas, opening date).

**What was decided, and why**
- "Apex Roofing of the Lowcountry" is never shortened in an SEO title, because "Lowcountry" is part of the official brand name. The Lowcountry area variants aren't added on top in SEO titles, site-wide (Paul).

## /drive-mirror · 2026-10-05 · run 20261005-223638-drive-mirror-d324

**What I did**
- Archive-and-replace after Paul's `entity_approved`. Approval Record, Brand Guide, Handoff Log and Document Checklist: each old copy got a dated name and moved into `_Archive`, and the new version was uploaded under the standard name.
- Uploaded the approved Discovery Record as a new file, `Apex Roofing of the Lowcountry - Discovery Record - APPROVED.md`, in `01 - Discovery and Audit/Deliverables` (content identical to the approved version).

**What was decided, and why**
- The REVIEW copy of the Discovery Record stays where it is in Deliverables. It moves to `_Archive` only if Paul agrees (/approve step 5).
