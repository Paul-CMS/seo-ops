- 2026-10-05T21:53 · run 20261005-215259-discovery-acd3 · Paul (deviation from BB-105 smallest container): area entity is South Carolina Lowcountry (Q3885311), one level above the Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Port Royal MSA; reserved homepage variant South Carolina Lowcountry; category variants Roofing Contractor, Roofer, Roofers (Roof Mechanic excluded).

- 2026-10-05T22:12 · run 20261005-221139-discovery-5ddf · Paul (supersedes the earlier decision this day): area entity is the Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Port Royal SC MSA (Q17020871), the BB-105 smallest container, because the brand name already carries Lowcountry into every SEO title. Reserved homepage variant: Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Port Royal Metropolitan Area. South Carolina Lowcountry and Lowcountry stay in the pool but never in an SEO title.
- 2026-10-05T22:33 · run 20261005-223335-discovery-40fe · Paul: brand written in full (Apex Roofing of the Lowcountry) in every SEO title that carries it - Lowcountry is part of the official brand name; Lowcountry area variants not added on top in SEO titles, site-wide. Reserved variant wording: Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Port Royal Metropolitan Area (Wikipedia form; Q8: no Metro shortening).
- 2026-10-07T14:49 · run 20261007-144926-discovery-20d6 · Paul: 'residential' is used as a description in headings and page text (e.g. residential roofing contractor), not as a category name variant; the approved entity is unchanged. Paul: no phone line on the proof sheet.
- 2026-10-07T15:14 · run 20261007-151404-discovery-f9a6 · Paul: address option (a) - 6 Sutton Ct stays hidden on the GBP (service-area business); the approved Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Port Royal metro area stays the area entity. Street address on the website only if wanted. Paul answered the 8 follow-up questions himself; the sheet is not sent to the client. Owner titles not published (sources conflict); site keeps 'Founded by Ralph and Pierce Brehany'.
- 2026-10-07T20:01 · run 20261007-194242-discovery-9495 · Gate B: 2 questions raised, both to Paul. Q1 service-title format (SVC-03 vs Brand Guide B2 note; conflict CF-LOCAL-001) blocks F-014 and the title side of F-004 - default: Service Name - Brand, no area. Q2 homepage shows all 8 services as H3 vs BB-313 max 5-6 blocks the HP-11 part of F-023 - default: all 8, logged as a Paul Exception. No VA questions. Specs are DRAFT (advisory). CM-026 cited. · affects F-014,F-004,F-023
- 2026-10-07T20:10 · run 20261007-194242-discovery-9495 · Gate B Q1 (Paul): option 1a for this client - service-page SEO titles are 'Service Name - Brand' with no area term, because 'Lowcountry' in the brand name already carries the service-area entity. Overrides the B2 note's 'SEO titles take the metro-area/county variants' for service pages (B2 text to be aligned with Paul's re-approval of the entity sections). Homepage title keeps the reserved variant (B1). · affects F-014,F-004
- 2026-10-07T20:10 · run 20261007-194242-discovery-9495 · Gate B Q2 (Paul): option 2a - the rebuilt homepage links all 8 services as H3 links (Paul Exception to BB-313's 5-6). · affects F-023
- 2026-10-08T07:33 · run 20261008-073331-discovery-a866 · Paul (supersedes the 2026-10-05 reserved variant): the homepage SEO title carries 'Hilton Head Island Metropolitan Area' (Wikipedia article title, a real name); the homepage H1 uses a familiar pool variant - Lowcountry or South Carolina Lowcountry. 'Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Port Royal Metropolitan Area' moves to the pool. Rules CF-LOCAL-002 (HP-06 vs BB-304): reserved variant in the title, pool variant in the H1. B2 now states service titles 'Service Name - Brand' (Gate B 1a).
